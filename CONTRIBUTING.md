**! 🚀  
  DartAPI Auth is a lightweight and extensible authentication package for Dart backend applications.

  and validation mechanisms. The package ensures security through issuer and audience validation, 
  expiration handling, and signature verification. Ideal for API authentication in Dart projects.
